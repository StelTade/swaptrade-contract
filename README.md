# SwapTrade Contracts

This repository contains **Soroban smart contracts** for [SwapTrade](https://github.com/your-org/swaptrade), an educational trading simulator built on the **Stellar ecosystem**. 

The contracts replicate key features of real-world cryptocurrency trading in a **risk-free, simulated environment**:

## Features
- **Virtual Assets**: Mint and manage simulated XLM and Stellar-issued tokens.  
- **Trading Simulation**: Execute token swaps and practice liquidity provision using Stellarâ€™s native AMM model.  
- **Portfolio Tracking**: Track balances, trades, and performance through contract state.  
- **Gamification**: Unlock badges, achievements, and rewards as users progress.  
- **Extensible Design**: Contracts are modular, allowing new features like staking or yield farming to be added.

## Tech Stack
- **Soroban** (Rust) for smart contracts  
- **Stellar SDK** for frontend/backend integration  
- **Soroban CLI** for contract deployment and testing

## Getting Started
1. Install [Soroban CLI](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/getting-started/setup).
2. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/swaptrade-contracts.git
   cd swaptrade-contracts

âš¡ This positions the repo as the **smart contracts engine** for SwapTrade, with **Soroban as the backbone** and **Stellarâ€™s DEX/AMM as the environment**.  

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also prepare a **GitHub repo topics/tags list** (like `stellar`, `soroban`, `dex`, `amm`, `defi`, `trading-simulator`) so itâ€™s discoverable to Stellar devs?
